        <h2 class="exercise-name">Jumping Jacks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type</strong> Cardio</li>
            <li><strong>Target Muscles</strong> Full Body Warm Up.</li>
            <li><strong>Notes</strong> Jumping jacks are a versatile full-body aerobic exercise that can be performed almost anywhere without any equipment.
                Starting in a standing position with feet together and arms at your sides, you jump to spread your feet out to the sides while simultaneously raising your arms above your head, forming an "X" shape at the peak.
                Then, quickly jump back to the starting position, lowering your arms. Aiming for 20-30 repetitions or incorporating them into a timed workout is effective. They offer numerous benefits, including boosting cardiovascular health by raising the heart rate, engaging multiple muscle groups (legs, arms, core) for a comprehensive workout, and enhancing coordination and agility.
                This makes jumping jacks a practical exercise for all fitness levels. </li>

        <h2 class="exercise-name">Plank</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type</strong> Cardio</li>
            <li><strong>Target Muscles</strong> The core (transversus abdominis, rectus abdominis, and oblique muscles), Shoulders (deltoids), Upper body (lats, triceps, traps, chest, biceps, rhomboids).</li>
            <li><strong>Notes</strong> Planks are a core-strengthening exercise that targets multiple muscle groups, enhancing stability and posture.
            To perform a plank, start in a push-up position but with your forearms on the ground, elbows aligned below the shoulders, and arms parallel to the body at about shoulder-width distance.
            Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels without sagging or arching the back. Engage your core, thighs, and glutes to maintain the position. Aim to hold this pose for 20 to 30 seconds initially, gradually increasing the duration as you build strength.
            Planks are highly beneficial for improving core strength, which is crucial for stability and reducing the risk of back pain. </li>

        <h2 class="exercise-name">Jump Squats</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type</strong> Cardio And Muscle</li>
            <li><strong>Target Muscles</strong> Glutes, Quads, Hips, and Hamstrings. </li>
            <li><strong>Notes</strong> Jump-squats are a dynamic, plyometric exercise that combines traditional squats with an explosive jump for added cardiovascular and strength benefits.
                Begin by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lower into a squat position by bending your knees and pushing your hips back, keeping your back straight and chest up. From the squat, explosively jump up as high as you can, swinging your arms for momentum. Land softly back into the squat position and immediately jump again. Aim for multiple repetitions, starting with sets of 10-15 jumps.
                Jump-squats are excellent for building lower body strength, improving balance, and enhancing cardiovascular endurance, making them a great addition to a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) routine. </li>
